2021/11/4,Carbon Market Talks Break Down on Revenue Dispute,"Talks at COP26 on international carbon markets are running into an obstacle: a row over how big a share of revenue from trading should be funneled toward countries that need money to adapt to climate change. Negotiations on carbon trading are one of the key issues in Glasgow, Scotland, and a deal would represent a big success. The last round of talks in Madrid fell apart over the gnarly issue and it remains one of the last parts of the Paris Agreement that still needs to be hashed outThis is the debate: Developing countries want a percentage of the proceeds from trading all types of carbon credits. That sort of transaction tax has been applied to a previous UN offset program and is widely expected to continue in any new marketBut developing countries say it should also apply to the exchange of carbon credits between countries. And that‚Äôs a red line for the EU‚ÄúWe, with other market participants are not prepared to accept any kind of mandatory extension,‚Ä?said Jacob Werksman, EU negotiator at the talks in Glasgow",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Research from the Swiss Finance Institute argues stocks highly rated on environmental, social and governance metrics have outperformed in recent years due to the trillions of dollars flooding the sector.
